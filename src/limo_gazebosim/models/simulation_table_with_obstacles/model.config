	LIMO's simulation table with green areas as represented obstacles. A basic version with all 16 parts arranged into a squared arena.
  The background texture is based on a low res texture from the LIMO's simulation table user manual, 
  which was then vectorised in Inkscape. The source vector file is materials/textures/simulation_table_vector.svg 
  and can be used for export to PNG (@150 dpi) in Inkscape.
